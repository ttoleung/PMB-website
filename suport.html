      <div class="answers">
          <h2 id="0">What problem are we solving?</h2>
          <p >
            PrimaBlock handles the accounting and remittance work involved in pooling funds from lots of contributors to participate in an ICO.
          </p>
          <h2 id="1">How does PrimaBlock work at a high level?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A community wants to participate in an ICO presale.</li>
            <li>The leader of the community sets up a pool in PrimaBlock.</li>
            <li>The pool can use a whitelist so that only specific community members can contribute, or be left open for anyone to contribute.</li>
            <li>Once enough ETH is collected, the pool's funds can be sent to the ICO team.</li>
            <li>Eventually, the tokens are generated and then sent back to the pool's smart contract.</li>
            <li>Once that happens, the pool administrator will need to confirm that the correct tokens were delivered to the contract.</li>
            <li>Finally, everyone in the pool can claim their tokens.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="2">As a pool admin, what do I need from the ICO team?</h2>
          <p>The ICO team needs to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Send you the payout address.</li>
            <li>If the payout address is a contract, send you the data field you need to use (if any).</li>
            <li>If the payout address is a contract with a whitelist system, they need to whitelist the pool contract address (i.e. the ethereum address in your pool URL).</li>
            <li>Once you sent the funds to the team, they will need to check for the transaction in the "Internal Transaction" tab on Etherscan.</li>
            <li>Send your tokens to the pool contract address (i.e. the ethereum address in your pool URL).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="3">Can I chain pools?</h2>
          <p>Yes, pool chaining is supported.</p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>You open the pool P2 on PrimaBlock with the pool P1 contract address.</li>
            <li>Then you click on contribute, set the amount you will be paying out from P1.</li>
            <li>You will get the screen with the transaction data. Copy the address and data field.</li>
            <li>Then you go on the admin dashboard of the pool P1 and click on payout.</li>
            <li>You fill the address and data field with the info you just copied, generate and send the transaction.</li>
            <li>
              Once the tokens arrived in the pool P2, if auto distrib is enabled, then you will get the tokens in your own pool directly. Otherwise, contact us and we will give you the right transaction to send. It is not yet availalbe on the UI.
              Same in case of a refund.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2  id="4">How can I test the service before running a real pool?</h2>
          <p>We offer a test version on the Rinkeby network.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go to
              <a href="https://www.mycrypto.com/">MyCrypto</a> or 
              <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/">MEW</a> and switch the network (top right corner) to Rinkeby.
            </li>
            <li>Create a new wallet.</li>
            <li>Get Rinkeby ETH from the faucet at:
              <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">https://faucet.rinkeby.io/</a>
            </li>
            <li>Open PrimaBlock test version at: 
              <a href="https://rinkeby.primablock.com">https://rinkeby.primablock.com</a>
            </li>
            <li>You can now create pools, contribute, payout... with your test wallet.</li>
            <li>You can get a fixed amount of our test ERC20 token by sending any amount of Rinkeby ETH to the token contract address: 0xbeEd3a18750DC050b2799b12ffAE602F26Ce5D57</li>
            <li>When you are done, do not forget to switch back MyCrypto to the main network!</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="5">Can PrimaBlock be used for tokens outside of Ethereum?</h2>
          <p>
            No, for now PrimaBlock only supports exchanging ETH for ERC20 or ERC223 tokens.
          </p>

          <h2 id="6">Which ethereum wallets work well with PrimaBlock?</h2>
          <p>
            PrimaBlock has been extensively tested with MyEtherWallet and MyCrypto, but should work with any ethereum wallet allowing you to set the data field of a transaction.
          </p>

          <h2 id="7">Why can I trust this product to handle my cryptocurrency transactions?</h2>
          <p>
            We do not ask at any point for your wallet credentials (private key). Instead, we will provide you with the information you need to perform the transaction yourself.
          </p>

          <h2 id="8">Is the smart contract considered to be open source software?</h2>
          <p>
            We retain full ownership and rights on its usage, publication, modification and any other use. Please contact us if you wish to deploy or use the smart contract outside of the PrimaBlock website.
          </p>

          <h2 id="9">Can I use your smart contract as inspiration for my own?</h2>
          <p>
            It's best if you don't look at our smart contract. Feel free to consult with a lawyer on the legal consequences of lifting parts of our smart contract without our permission.
          </p>

          <h2 id="10">Are PrimaBlock pools trustless?</h2>
          <p>
            Absolutely not!
          </p>

          <p>
            Any ether (ETH) you transfer to the pool will be managed by the admins of the pool. Our smart contract cannot fully prevent the pool admins from mismanaging the pool's funds. You should only participate in pools managed by individuals you trust.
          </p>

          <h2 id="11">If you could lock the pay out address then that would make PrimaBlock trustless. Can you add that feature?</h2>
          <p>
            This is a misconception many people have. There are two parts to a presale deal. Making the payment and receiving the tokens. If you lock the pay out address
            and your contributors can verify that the payout address belongs to the ICO then that makes the payment secure. However, the pool admin can still arrange to receive the
            tokens in their own wallet rather than at the pool's smart contract. This makes it possible for the pool admin to run off with all the pool's tokens.
          </p>

          <h2 id="12">Is it possible to require consensus among all the pool admins before paying out the pool?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, you can create a pool using a multisig wallet where there is only 1 admin (the multisig wallet). Whenever you need to send a transaction from the multisig wallet
            to perform an admin operation, the multisig wallet will require multiple signatures to confirm the transaction.
          </p>

          <h2 id="13">Can I add a pool admin once the pool has been created?</h2>
          <p>
            No the pool admins can only be assigned when creating the pool. No modifications to the admin list can be made after a pool has been created.
          </p>

          <h2 id="14">I want to contribute to some pools. Where can I find pools?</h2>
          <p>
            We do not promote any specific pools on our platform because it’s up to the pool admins to decide how wide of an audience they want to expose to their pools. You will have to get invited to a pool by a pool admin. Please keep in mind that
            you should not contribute to random pools where you are not comfortable with the pool admin because PrimaBlock is not trustless.
          </p>

          <h2 id="15">Can I send the funds in my pool in batches to the ICO?</h2>
          <p>
            No, you can only pay out the pool once.
          </p>

          <h2 id="16">What if the ICO has a vesting schedule and will send out the tokens in multiple batches?</h2>
          <p>
            PrimaBlock will keep track of all tokens sent to the pool's smart contract and ensure that each contributor will be able to claim their appropriate share of the tokens.
            Note contributors are free to claim tokens multiple times. For example, in a scenario where tokens are delivered in two transactions to a pool, a contributor may decide
            to claim their tokens after each distribution event, or they may prefer to wait until the last distribution event to claim their tokens in one fell swoop.
          </p>

          <h2 id="17">Are there ever any fees to use PrimaBlock?</h2>
          <p>
            We only charge a 0.5% fee per pool to support the platform and its users.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also allow pool admins to charge an additional fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you create a pool with auto distribution enabled PrimaBlock will also deduct some ether from the pool to pay
            for the distribution gas costs.
          </p>

          <h2 id="18">What is auto distribution?</h2>
          <p>
            When you create a pool, you will be able to activate the automatic distribution feature. When you enable this feature you need to specify the number of token drops you expect to receive from the ICO.
            Then whenever tokens are deposited to the pool our back-end will automatically distribute them to all the pool contributors.
            Which means that the contributors will not have to go through the claim tokens flow (visit their contributor dashboard, click get my tokens, go to MyCrypto, send the transaction to get tokens, etc).
          </p>

          <h2 id="19">What if I don't know how many token distribution events there will be?</h2>
          <p>
            Even if auto distribution is enabled, your contributors will always be able to claim tokens from your pool manually. Which means that even if you underestimate how many token drops there will be, your contributors
            will still be able to get all their tokens from the pool manually.
          </p>

          <h2 id="20">Is there any reason not to use auto distribution?</h2>
          <p>
            Auto distribution makes it harder to predict what amount will be paid out to the ICO team
            because the gas costs which are deducted for auto distribution are based on the number of contributors to the pool instead of being a flat fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also your contributors can save a bit on gas costs if they can claim their tokens themselves (assuming they know how to set a gas price intelligently)
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefit of auto distribution is that your contributors don’t have to perform any operation to get their tokens.
          </p>

          <h2 id="21">Are fees taken if a pool is cancelled or refunded?</h2>
          <p>
            No. Fees are only taken after the pool admin confirms that the tokens have been delivered to the pool.
          </p>

          <h2 id="22">Are auto distribution fees taken if a pool is cancelled or refunded?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes. In either of those events, our back-end use the auto distribution fees to refund each contributor's ether.
          </p>

          <h2 id="23">I created a pool. When will I receive my fees?</h2>
          <p>
            The fees are held in escrow until either tokens have been confirmed or the pool is refunded.
          </p>

          <h2 id="24">What does the "confirm tokens" button do?</h2>
          <p>
            Once the tokens you pooled for have been delivered to the smart contract address, you can click on this button to confirm the receipt of the tokens you pooled for.
            Then, you will enter the token contract address so the smart contract is able to understand which type of tokens have been delivered to the pool.
            After you complete this operation, the tokens will be ready for distribution (unless there's a lockup period). It is also at this point that fees are released
            from the pool smart contract.
          </p>

          <h2 id="25">What's the most amount of ether I can raise in one pool?</h2>
          <p>
            1 billion ETH.
          </p>

          <h2 id="26">What’s the maximum number of contributors I can organize in a pool?</h2>
          <p>
            There is no limit to the number of members you can have in your pool. However, there are gas costs associated
            for editing contribution limits that are proportional to the number of members in the pool. This means it may not
            be possible to edit certain contribution limits on a pool with over a 100 members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding a whitelist can also be an expensive operation depending on the number of members you have in your pool. However,
            you can add a whitelist in several transactions to get around the block gas limit. We recommend
            including a maximum of 50 members at a time when modifying whitelists. So if you would like to have a
            whitelist of 150 members, we recommend splitting that into 3 separate ethereum transactions each
            consisting of 50 members.

          <h2 id="27">What are the transaction costs?</h2>
          <p>
            Whenever you perform an operation with PrimaBlock we display the gas limit associated with each operation. That will provide
            you an upper bound on the cost of the transaction.
          </p>

          <h2 id="28">Can I lower the gas limit on my transactions?</h2>
          <p>
            No, do not edit any of the transaction fields displayed on the PrimaBlock transaction page.
          </p>

          <h2 id="29">The "To Address" field displayed on the PrimaBlock transaction page isn't what I expected, should I change the value?</h2>
          <p>
            No, do not edit any of the transaction fields displayed on the PrimaBlock transaction page.
          </p>

          <h2 id="30">Can I withdraw my contribution?</h2>
          <p>
            While the pool is open, you are free to adjust your contribution size by contributing or withdrawing. But, once a pool
            has been paid, you will not be able to make adjustments to your contribution.

            The pool admin may decide to cancel or refund the pool, at which point you’ll be able to withdraw funds from the pool.
          </p>

          <h2 id="31">Why isn’t my dashboard updating after I complete a transaction?</h2>
          <p>
              The dashboard sometimes lags behind the smart contract. But eventually the dashboard should be consistent with the smart contract. If an hour has passed since the transaction was confirmed and your dashboard is still out of date, please contact us.
          </p>

          <h2 id="32">Why is my transaction taking so long?</h2>
          <p>
            Read up on how to set the gas price for an ethereum transaction. Also be sure to understand the difference between gas price and gas limits.
